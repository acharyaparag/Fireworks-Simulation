Fireworks-Simulation
====================

Particle system was used to implement a Fireworks Simulation in C++ and OpenGL. Two main classes were used: Rocket and Spark. Rocket shoots up in the sky and is not affected by gravity. When the lifespan of rocket reaches a particular threshold 1000â€™s of Spark objects were created with rocket position as their initial position. The particles fade out eventually after a certain period of time
